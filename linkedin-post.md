Been working on this vintage Indian car marketplace called "Desi Classics" and honestly, it turned into something way cooler than I expected.

Started as a simple React project but got completely obsessed with making it feel authentic. You know that nostalgic vibe when you see an old Ambassador or Premier Padmini? Wanted to capture that digitally.

Some stuff I'm actually proud of:

The horizontal scroll gallery - spent way too much time getting the physics right with Lenis, but now it feels like you're actually walking through a vintage showroom

Added this AI assistant called "Chacha AI" (because every Indian uncle knows everything about cars, right?) - integrated Gemini to answer questions about these old beauties

The whole design language - film grain, sepia tones, amber colors. Even added a custom cursor because why not go all in?

Built the "Resurrection Protocol" section to show how these cars get restored. The animations are smooth as butter thanks to Framer Motion.

Honestly learned more about storytelling through UI than I expected. It's not just about making things look pretty - every scroll, hover, and transition needs to feel intentional.

The tech stack is React 19 + TypeScript, but the real challenge was making modern web tech feel vintage without being cheesy.

Still tweaking things, but pretty happy with how it captures that old-school Indian automotive charm while being a modern web experience.

Anyone else get way too deep into side projects? 😅
