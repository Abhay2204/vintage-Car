Remember that Ambassador your dad drove? The one with the sofa-like back seat?

I just built something for everyone who misses those days.

"Desi Classics" - where vintage Indian cars get the digital treatment they deserve.

🎬 What I created:
• Horizontal scroll physics that feels like walking through a vintage showroom
• Custom cursor with trailing effects (because why not?)
• Film grain overlay for that authentic 70s vibe
• "Chacha AI" - Gemini-powered vintage car expert who talks like your car-obsessed uncle

🔧 The tech that makes it smooth:
• React 19 + TypeScript foundation
• Framer Motion for cinematic animations
• Lenis for buttery physics-based scrolling
• Custom scroll-triggered galleries
• Sepia tones, amber gradients, vintage typography

The hardest part? Making modern web tech feel authentically vintage without being cheesy.

Every hover reveals hidden specs. Every scroll tells a story. Even the loading states have character.

Built it because these machines deserve better than just rusting away in garages.

Sometimes the best projects come from pure nostalgia.
