Last week I fell in love with an old Ambassador photo on my grandfather's desk.

Today I shipped "Desi Classics" - and it taught me more about UI/UX than any tutorial ever could.

🎯 THE CHALLENGE:
How do you make users *feel* the weight of vintage Indian automotive history through a screen?

� MY eUI/UX APPROACH:

**Visual Storytelling**
→ Hero section with cinematic car slides and custom typography
→ Film grain overlay + sepia tones for authentic vintage feel
→ Amber color palette inspired by old Bombay street lights

**Interaction Design**  
→ Horizontal scroll gallery - vertical scroll transforms into walking through cars
→ Custom cursor that follows movement (because details matter)
→ Hover states reveal hidden car specs with smooth transitions
→ Loading animations that have personality, not just spinners

**Emotional Architecture**
→ "Resurrection Protocol" - storytelling through restoration steps
→ Each car card feels like opening a vintage photo album
→ Micro-interactions that whisper "heritage" instead of screaming "modern"

⚡ REACT IMPLEMENTATION:

• **Framer Motion** - for cinematic page transitions and staggered animations
• **Lenis** - physics-based smooth scrolling (spent 3 days perfecting the feel)
• **React 19 + TypeScript** - component architecture that scales
• **Custom hooks** - for scroll-triggered animations and state management
• **Gemini AI integration** - "Chacha AI" vintage car expert with custom chat UI

🔥 THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT:
When I realized great UI isn't about following trends - it's about creating emotional connections. Every scroll, hover, and click should transport users somewhere special.

The horizontal scroll physics, the way text fades as you explore cars, the custom cursor - these aren't just "cool effects." They're storytelling tools.

**What I learned:**
- Performance matters more when animations are complex
- Accessibility in custom interactions requires extra thought  
- Sometimes breaking UI conventions creates better experiences
- React's new concurrent features make smooth animations easier

This project pushed my frontend skills further than any client work. When you're passionate about the story you're telling, the code writes itself differently.

Currently exploring how to make this a platform for vintage car collectors across India.

What's the most emotionally connected UI you've ever built?
